My personal website with a little about me and what I've done. Some features of
my site are:

- it is unnecessarily built with react
- if you look through its history it has gone through complete overhauls many
  times, but it still only looks like this
- it is very possible that things are slightly inaccurate (in terms of the
  build not the content)
